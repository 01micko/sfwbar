.SH NAME
SFWBar \- Sway Floating Window taskBar
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBsfwbar\fP [options]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBSFWBar\fP is a taskbar for wayland compositors. Originally written for Sway,
it should work with any compositor supporting layer\-shell protocol. SFWBar
assists in handling of floating windows on a wayland desktop. It provdes a
taskbar, a pager, a task switcher, a system tray, a floating window placement
engine, a simple widget set for display data extracted from various system
files.
SFWBar can work with any wayland compositor supporting layer shell protocol.
Taskbar and switcher require either sway or wlr\-foreign\-toplevel protocol
support. Placer and  pager require sway.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
SFWBar executable can be invoked with the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f | \-\-config
Specify a filename of a configuration file
.TP
.B \-c | \-\-css
Specify a filename of a css file
.TP
.B \-s | \-\-socket
Specify a location of sway ipc socket
.TP
.B \-m | \-\-monitor
Specify a monitor to display the bar on ("\-m list" to list available monitors)
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
SFWBar reads configuration from a config file (sfwbar.config by default). The
program checks users XDG config directory (usually ~/.config/sfwbar/) for this
file, followed by system xdg data directories. Additionally, user can specify
a location and a name of the config file using \fB\-f\fP command line option.
.sp
Appearance of the program can be specifie using CSS properties, these
are sourced either from the css section of the main configuration file or
from a file sfwbar.css located in the same directory as the config
file. The name of the css file can be also specified using \fB\-c\fP option.
.sp
The config file consists of the following top level sections:
.SS Placer
.sp
Placer section enables intelligent placement of new floating windows. If
enabled the program will first attemp to place the window in a location, where
it won\(aqt overlap with other windows. If such location doesn\(aqt exist, the window
will be placed in a cascading pattern from top\-left to bottom\-right. The Placer
declaration accepts parameters "xstep" and "ystep" that specify the
steps in the window cascade. These are specified in percentage of the desktop
dimensions. The cascade placement will start at a location specified by "xorigin"
"yorigin" parameters. I.e.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
placer {
  xorigin = 5
  yorigin = 5
  xstep = 5
  ystep = 5
  children = false
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
"children" parameter specifies if new windows opened by a program with other
windows already opened should be placed. These are usually dialog windows and
SFWBar won\(aqt place them by default. If the placer section is not present in
the file, SFWBar will let the compositor determine the locations for new windows.
.SS Task Switcher
.sp
Task switcher implements a keyboard shortcut to cycle focus across windows
(i.e. Alt\-Tab). The action is triggered upon receiving a change in a bar
hidden_state property or signal SIGUSR1. This can be configured in Sway, via
one of the following bindings:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bindsym Alt\-Tab bar hidden_state toggle
or
bindsym Alt\-Tab exec killall \-SIGUSR1 sfwbar
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(for non\-sway compositors, use SIGUSR1 trigger)
.sp
Task switcher is configured in the "switcher" section of the configuration file.
The following parameters are accepted:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B interval
an timeout after the last task switch event after which the selected
window is activated
.TP
.B labels [true|false]
display window titles in the task list
.TP
.B icons [true|false]
display window icons in the task list
.TP
.B cols
a number of columns in the task list
.TP
.B css
css code applicable to the switcher grid.
You can specify more detailed css code in the main CSS file. Using style
name #switcher for the task switcher window and the main grid and names
#switcher_normal and #switcher_active for inactive and active window
representations respectively.
.UNINDENT
.SS Layout
.sp
Defines the layout of the taskbar. The layout holds a set of widgets. Widgets
can be nested in case of a \fBgrid\fP widget, which acts as a container.
.sp
The following widget types are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B taskbar
a special widget displaying a list of all floating windows.
(requires a compositor supporting wlr\-foreign\-toplevel protocol or i3 ipc)
.TP
.B pager

(requires a compositor supporting wlr\-foreign\-toplevel protocol or i3 ipc)
.TP
.B tray
a special widget displaying a list of tray icons received via status
notifier item interface
.TP
.B grid
a layout grid capable of containing other widgets. You can use these to
further subdivide each cell of the main grid and arrange items within it.
.TP
.B label

.UNINDENT
.sp
Each widget is placed within the parent grid. By default, widgets are placed
next to the previous widget along the "direction" of the grid (left to right
by default). You can specify widget\(aqs positions within a grid by using a
property "loc(x,y[,w,h])" with the first two parameters specifying the location
of the widget within the parent grid and the last two parameters specifying the
widget dimensions in grid cells:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
layout {
  label {
  style = "mystyle"
  value = SwapUsed / SwapTotal + "%"
  loc(2,1,1,1)
  }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
External widgets can be included in layout using the following syntax:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
layout {
  include("MyWidget.widget")
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above will include all scanner variables data and widget sub\-layout from
file MyWidget.widget
.sp
Grid widgets can contain other widgets, these are declared within the grid definition
following the parent grid properties. i.e.

(i.e. \fB"string"\fP or \fB1\fP) or an expression (i.e.
\fB"Value is:" + $MyString\fP or \fB2 * MyNumber.val\fP). See \fBexpressions\fP
section for more detail.
For \fBLabel\fP widgets value tells text to display.
For \fBScale\fP widgets it speficies a fraction to display.
For \fBImage\fP widgets and buttons it provides an icon or an image file name.
.TP
.B style
a style name for the widget. Styles can be used in CSS to theme widgets.
Multiple widgets can have the same style. A style name can be used in css
using gtk+ named widget convention, i.e. \fBlabel#mystyle\fP\&. Style property
can be set to an expression to change styles in response to changes in
system parameters.
.TP
.B tooltip
sets a tooltip for a widget. A tooltip can be a static value or an
expression. In case of the latter, the tooltip will be dynamically
updated every time it pops up.

.SS Functions
.sp
Functions are sequences of actions. They are used when multiple actions need
to be execute on a single triggeer. A good example of this functionality is
dynamically constructed menus generated by an external script:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function("fancy_menu") {
  MenuClear "dynamic_menu"
  PipeRead "$HOME/bin/buildmenu.sh"
  Menu "dynamic_menu"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above example clears a menu, executes a script that builds a menu again
and opens the resulting menu.
.sp
Function "SfwBarInit" executed on startup. You can use this functions to set
initial parameters for the bar, such as default monitor and layer.
.SS Scanner
.sp
SFWBar widgets display data obtained from various sources. These can be files
or output of commands.
.sp
Each source section contains one or more variables that SFWBar will poll
periodically and populate with the data parsed from the source. The sources
and variables linked to them as configured in the section \fBscanner\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
scanner {
  file("/proc/swaps",NoGlob) {
    SwapTotal = RegEx("[\et ]([0\-9]+)")
    SwapUsed = RegEx("[\et ][0\-9]+[\et ]([0\-9]+)")
  }
  exec("getweather.sh") {
    $WeatherTemp = Json(".forecast.today.degrees")
  }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each declaration within the \fBscanner\fP section specifies a source. This can
be one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B File
Read data from a file
.TP
.B Exec
Read data from an output of a shell command
.TP
.B MpdClient
Read data from Music Player Daemon IPC (data is polled whenever MPD
responds to an \(aqidle player\(aq event).
.TP
.B SwayClient
Receive updates on Sway state, updates are the json objects sent by sway,
wrapped into an object with a name of the event i.e.
\fBwindow: { sway window change object }\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The file source also accepts further optional argumens specifying how
scanner should handle the source, these can be:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B NoGlob
specifies that SFWBar shouldn\(aqt attempt to expand the pattern in
the file name. If this flag is not specified, the file source will
attempt to read from all files matching a filename pattern.
.TP
.B CheckTime
indicates that the program should only update the variables from
this file when file modification date/time changes.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBVariables\fP are extracted from sources using parsers, currently the following
parsers are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Grab([Aggregator])
specifies that the data is copied from the file verbatim
.TP
.B RegEx(Pattern[,Aggregator])
extracts data using a regular expression parser, the variable is assigned
data from the first capture buffer
.TP
.B Json(Path[,Aggregator])
extracts data from a json structure. The path starts with a separator
character, which is followed by a path with elements separated by the
same character. The path can contain numbers to indicate array indices
i.e. \fB\&.data.node.1.string\fP and key checks to filter arrays, i.e.
\fB\&.data.node.[key="blah"].value\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Optional aggregators specify how multiple occurences of numeric data are treated.
The following aggregators are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B First
Variable should be set to the first occurence of the pattern in the source
.TP
.B Last
Variable should be set to the last occurence of the pattern in the source
.TP
.B Sum
Variable should be set to the sum of all  occurences of the pattern in the
source
.TP
.B Product
Variable should be set to the product of all  occurences of the pattern in the
source
.UNINDENT
.sp
For string variables, Sum and Product aggregators are treated as Last.
.SH EXPRESSIONS
.sp
Values in widgets can contain basic arithmetic and string manipulation
expressions. These allow transformation of data obtained by the scanner before
it is displayed by the widgets.
