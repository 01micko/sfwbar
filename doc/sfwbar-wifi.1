.TH "SFWBAR-WIFI" "1" "" ""
.SH NAME
sfwbar-wifi \- Sfwbar Wifi interface
.sp
Filename: wifi\-iwd.so
Filename: wifi\-nm.so
.sp
Requires: none
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
Wifi module interface provides means to query and control the wifi network.
There are currently two modules providing this interface: wifi\-iwd provides
support for IWD daemon and wifi\-nm provides support for NetworkManager.
.sp
\fB* In order to use wifi\-iwd module, the user must have permission to control
iwd daemon. Usually permissions are granted by adding the user to \(ganetdev\(ga or
\(gawheel\(ga user group *\fP
.SH EXPRESSION FUNCTIONS
.SS WifiGet(Property)
.sp
function WifiGet queries a property for a currently advertized iwd network.
The supported properties are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \(dqPath\(dq
an object path of the device, this is used as a unique id to provide
notifications of changes or destruction of the device and to control
the device. This property is valid upon receipt of \fIwifi_updated\fP trigger.
.TP
.B \(dqRemovedPath\(dq
an object path of the most recently removed device. This is populated
upon emission of the \fIwifi_removed\fP trigger.
.TP
.B \(dqSSID\(dq
an SSID of the network.
.TP
.B \(dqType\(dq
a Type of the network (\(aqopen\(aq, \(aqwep\(aq, \(aqpsk\(aq or \(aq8021x\(aq)
.TP
.B \(dqKnown\(dq
an indcator of whether this is a known network (\(dq1\(dq = known, \(dq0\(dq = new)
.TP
.B \(dqStrength\(dq
signal strength of the network (a string containing a number in range 1\-100 )
.TP
.B \(dqConnected\(dq
an indicator of whether the daemon is connected to the network
(\(dq1\(dq = connected, \(dq0\(dq = not connected)
.UNINDENT
.SH ACTIONS
.SS WifiScan <Duration>
.sp
Initiate scan for wireless networks.
.SS WifiAck
.sp
Notify the module that all information for the currently advertized network has
been processed. The module may then emit another \fIwifi_updated\fP event if further
network updates are available.
.SS WifiAckRemoved
.sp
Notify the module that all information for the currently advertized network
removal has been processed. The module may then emit another \fIwifi_removed\fP
event if further network removals are queued.
.SS WifiConnect <path>
.sp
Attempt to connect to a network specified by the path.
.SS WifiDisconnect <path>
.sp
Disconnect from a network specified by the path.
.SS WifiForget <path>
.sp
Forget a known network specified by the path.
.SH TRIGGERS
.sp
The module defines the following triggers:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \(dqwifi_level\(dq
This signal is emitted when signal strength for the current connection
changes.
.TP
.B \(dqwifi_updated\(dq
this trigger is emitted when a new network is discovered or properties of
a network are changed. Once the trigger is emitted, the information for the
relevant network will be available via \fIWifiGet\fP expression function. Once
the config finished handling the network update, it should call action
\fIWifiAck\fP\&.  Upon receipt of this action, the module may emit \fIwifi_updated\fP
again if further network updates are queued.
.TP
.B \(dqwifi_removed\(dq
this trigger is emitted when a network is no longer available and should be
removed from the layout. The path of the removed network is available via
\fIWifiGet(\(dqRemovedPath\(dq)\fP\&. Once the config finished removing the netowrk, it
should call action \fIWifiAckRemoved\fP\&. Upon receipt of this action, the module
may emit another \fIwifi_removed\fP trigger if further networks have been
removed.
.TP
.B \(dqwifi_scan\(dq
this trigger is emitted when scan for networks has been initiated.
.TP
.B \(dqwifi_scan_complete\(dq
this trigger is emitted when scan for networks is complete.
