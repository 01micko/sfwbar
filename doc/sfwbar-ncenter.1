.SH TRIGGERS
.sp
The module defines the following triggers:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \(dqnotification\-updated\(dq
this trigger is emitted when a new notification has been received or
properties of a notification are changed. For a notification with
multiple actions, this trigger is emitted once for every action.
Once the trigger is emitted, the information for the relevant notification
will be available via NotificationGet expression function. Once the config
finished handling the notification update, it should call action
NotificationAck. Upon receipt of this action, the module may emit
\(dqnotification\-updated\(dq again if further notification updates are queued.
.TP
.B \(dqnotification\-removed\(dq
this trigger is emitted when a notification is no longer available and should
be removed from the layout. The id of the removed notification is available
via NotificationGet(\(dqremoved\-id\(dq). Once the config finished removing the
notification, it should call action NotificationAckRemoved. Upon receipt of
this action, the module may emit another \(dqnotification\-removed\(dq trigger if
further notifications have been removed.
.TP
.B \(dqnotification\-group\(dq
this trigger is emitted when grouping state of notifications changes. I.e.
when any group is expanded or collapsed.
